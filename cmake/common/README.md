# cmake_scripts

CMake scripts shared among other repositories. 

## tools.cmake

It provides tools and wrappers useful in every project. Moreover it provides some patches 
and bugfixes for other external projects when they are not working properly.

**Tools and utilities**
- `conan_init()` - includes cmake files generated by Conan Package Manger if present and runs `conan_basic_setup(TARGETS)`
- `configure_and_install(configure_in_file_path, version_compare_rules)` - creates CMake package version and config files
     and istaslls them together with `${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME}Targets` ``EXPORT` target.

**Current list of patches**
- `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)` - fix for CMake not setting `/std:c++latest` for VS 2017
- `find_package(GTest)` - fix for compilation under VS 2017 with C++17 enabled


## compile_flags.cmake

Very restrictive compilation flags settings for Continuous Integration and local builds.
It should not be included directly in the main project CMakeLists.txt file to not force other users
using that library to compile their projects with our flags or even worse to modify their flags by
our scripts.
